## Biot-Savart Law

- basically Coulomb's law for $\vec{B}$
- $\mu_{0}$ is permeability constant

$$
\vec{B}_{\text{point charge}} = \frac{\mu_{0}qv\sin \theta}{4\pi r^{2}}
$$

## Biot-Savart Law

Using the Biot-Savart Law for a moving charge, we rewrite it in terms of many moving charges (current).

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{B} &= \int \frac{\mu_{0}v\sin \theta}{4\pi r^{2}} \, dq \\
&=  
\end{align}
