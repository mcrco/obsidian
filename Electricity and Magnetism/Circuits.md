- closed path that allows for flow of electrons
- movement of electrons -> current (amps) and drift

# Current

Current is defined as 

$$
I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t} = \frac{neA\Delta d}{\Delta t}
$$

The speed of electrons is called drift velocity and is defined as follows

$$
V_{d} = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}
$$

Current runs opposite to the flow of electrons.

## Current Density

Current density is the amount of current passing through a cross section of the conductor.

$$
J = \frac{I}{A}
$$

# Power

Power is defined as energy over time. Since we know that voltage is energy per charge, and current is charge over time, power is

$$
\begin{align}
P = \frac{dU}{dt} &= \frac{dV}{dq} \cdot \frac{dq}{dt} \\
&= IV \\
&=I^{2}R \\
&= \frac{V^{2}}{R}
\end{align}
$$
