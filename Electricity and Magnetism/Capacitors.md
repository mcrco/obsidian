# Capacitors

- basic capacitor: two conductive plates that are set a distance apart from each other
- holds charge by creating imbalance of charge in 2 sides

# Capacitance

Basic formula:

$$
C = \frac{Q}{V}
$$

Using Gauss's Law and some basic electrostatics formulas, we can derive a geometric formula for the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor.

First, plugging in the formula $V = Ed$:

$$
\begin{align}
C &= \frac{Q}{V} \\
&= \frac{Q}{Ed}
\end{align}
$$

Then, using Gauss's Law:

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{E}\vec{A} &= \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}} \\
\vec{E} &= \frac{Q}{\vec{A}\epsilon_{0}} \\
C &= \frac{\vec{A}\epsilon_{0}}{d}
\end{align}
$$

Now, we know that capacitance is 

- **$\propto$ area of a capacitor**
- **$\propto$ permittivity of the dielectric**
- **inversely $\propto$ distance between the conductive plates**.
