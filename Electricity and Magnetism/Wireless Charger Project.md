# Goal

Test 3 different wireless chargers and efficiencies:

1. regular induction
2. resonant inductive coupling
3. magnetic resonance

# Variables

## Constant

- inductance of inductors
	- number of coils: 20
	- diameter of coils: random can

## Variable

- resonant frequency: tuned by inductors and capacitor
	- capacitance and resistance 
- distance
	- test all charger/receiver pair efficiency at 1cm, 5cm, 10cm, 15cm, 30cm

# Materials

- copper wire
- capacitors
- resistors
- voltmeter
- ammeter
- power source

# Regular Inductive Charging

We can just use 2 coils + one hooked up to capacitor that we charge.
