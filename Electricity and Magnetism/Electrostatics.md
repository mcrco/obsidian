Atoms are made up of electrons ($e^{-}$), protons ($p^{+}$), and neutrons ($n$).

Electrons are ~ $9\cdot 10^{-31}$ kg. Protons are $1.6\cdot 10^{-17}$ kg. Neutrons are $1.7 \cdot 10^{-27}$.

Protons are made from 2 up quarks and 1 down quark. Neutrons are made from 2 down quarks and 1 up quarks. Down quarks are $9\cdot 10^{-30}$ kg, up quarks are $4 \cdot 10^{-30}$ kg.

# Millikan Oil Experiment

Purpose of research was to find charge. He tried different kinds of liquids and ended up on vacuum pumped oil because it was perfectly spherical so he can simplify his formula.

To conduct experiment, he shot an extremely small drop of oil and shot an xray to ionize it. It then would pass through an electric field.

The plan was to equate the force of the electric field on the ionized particle and the gravitational force in 

$$
\vec{F}_{e} = \vec{F}_{g} \implies \frac{qV}{d} = mg
$$

However, finding mass was not easy because 

$$
m_{oil} = \rho_{oil} V
$$

didn't hold true due to the radius of the spherical drop of oil not being constant.

To solve for mass, he used Stoke's law, which stated the drag force of the oil drop was $6\pi \eta rv$

$$
6\pi \eta rv

$$and that the force of gravity was 

$$
(\rho_{0} - \rho_{a})\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}g
$$ 

Equating the two,

$$
\begin{align}
6\pi \eta rv &= (\rho_0 - \rho_{a}) \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}g \\
r &= \sqrt{ \frac{9\eta v}{2g(\rho_{0} - \rho_{a})} } \\
\frac{qV}{d} &= \rho_{oil} \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\sqrt{ \frac{9\eta v}{2g(\rho_{0} - \rho_{a})} }\right)^{3}g \\
\implies q &= \frac{\rho_{oil} \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\sqrt{ \frac{9\eta v}{2g(\rho_{0} - \rho_{a})} }\right)^{3}gd}{V} \\
\implies q &= 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} \text{ Coloumbs}
\end{align}
