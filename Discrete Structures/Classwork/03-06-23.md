# Problem 1

## Theorem

$$
d|m \cap d|n \implies d | (m + n)
$$

## Proof

$$
\begin{align}
d|m &\implies m = ad \\
d|n &\implies m = bd \\
m + n &= ad + bd \\
&= (a + b)d
\end{align}
$$

Since $m + n$ can be expressed as a multiple of $d$, $d|(m + n)$.

# Problem 2

## Theorem

There are an infinite amount of primes.

## Proof (Indirect)

Suppose that there are a finite amount of primes, say 4: $2,3,5,7$.

Let $n = 2\cdot{3}\cdot{5} \cdot 7 + 1 = 211$

$n$ must be prime/not prime. 

$$
\begin{align}
n &= 1 \mod 2 \\
n &= 1 \mod 3 \\
n &= 1 \mod 5 \\
n &= 1 \mod 7
\end{align}
$$

Since we supposed that $2,3,5,7$ are the only existing primes, but $n$ is not divisible by any of them, $n$ is also a prime, contradicting our statement that there were only 4 primes.
