# Claim

Prove that for all $n \in Z$, $n$ is odd iff $n + 2$ is odd.

# Proof by Contradiction

## Proving $n$
Assume $n$  is odd but $n + 2$ is even

Let $n = 2p + 1$ by the definition of odd numbers

$$
\begin{align}
n &= 2p + 1 \\
n + 2 &= 2p + 1 + 2 \\
&= 2p + 3 \\
&= 2(p + 1) + 1
\end{align}
$$

This contradicts our assumption that $n + 2$ is even since it fits the definition of an odd number.
