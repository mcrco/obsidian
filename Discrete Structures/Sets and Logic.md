# Set

- collection of objects
- use {} to denote sets
- no order
- no duplicate objects

## Belonging

- basic function of set
- use $\in$

## Elements

- must limit elements of set
- don't -> Russel's paradox
	- set is element of itself??

## Empty Set

- nothing in it
	- null
- special
- write as {}

## Comparing 

- contains: $\subseteq$
- equals: $A \subseteq B, B \subset A \implies A = B$
- 

## Power Set

The power set is the set of all subsets of a set.
$$
P(\{ a,b \}) = \{\{  \}, \{ a \},\{ b \},\{ a,b \}\}
$$

## Cardinality

Cardinality is just the number of elements in set.

$$
A=\{ 1,2 \} \implies |A| = 2
$$

Since the power set of $A$ has $2^{|A|}$ elements, 

$$
|P(A)| = 2^{|A|}
$$
