1. A conditional proposition is like a logical if then statement. You use the $\implies$ operator.
6. A sufficient condition guarantees an event but is not necessary.
10. $P$ being logically equivalent to $Q$ means that the two propositions have the same value given the same input.
59. Symbolic: $4 < 6 \implies 9 > 12$
Converse: If 9 > 12, then 4 < 6. $9 > 12 \implies 4 < 6$.
Contrapositive: If $4 \geq 6$, then $9 \leq 12$. $4 \geq 6 \implies 9 \leq 12$

10. If 4 gigabytes is better than no memory at all, then we will buy a new computer. If 4 gb is bettery than no memory at all, then we will buy more memory. Therefore, if 4gb is better than nothing, then will buy more memory and a new computer.

# p. 48, #7, 8, 11, 12, 48, 63

7. 11 divides 77. This is true.
8. 1 divides 77. True.
11. There exists a number $n$ such that $n$ divides 77. True.
12. Not all numbers $n$ divide 77. True.
48. $\forall P(x) \, Q(x)$
63. The literal meaning is that not every hospital reported every month. The intended meaning is that none of the hospitals reported every month.
