1. 5366280699654138 -> 0
4. 419-6888-7169-444 -> invalid
17. both
18. neither
20. neither
29. Every output has at most one input. For every number in the codomain in the form $2^{m}3^{n}$, there is at most one tuple of inputs since prime factorizations are unique. For every number in the codomain not in the form, there is no input.
43. $X = \frac{Y - 2}{4}$
44. $X = \log_{3}Y$
45. $X = 2^{\frac{Y}{3}}$
50. $f \circ f$
