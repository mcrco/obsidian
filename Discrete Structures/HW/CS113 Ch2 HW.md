7. **Claim**: If $m$ and $n$ are even, $m + n$ is even
**Proof**:
Let $m = 2a$ and $n = 2b$ by the definition of an even number.
Then
$$
\begin{align}
m + n &= 2a + 2b \\
&= 2(a + b)
\end{align}
$$
The above shows that $m + n$ must be even since $2(a + b)$ is an even number by definition.

13. Claim: For all rational number $x$ and $y$, $x + y$ is rational.

Let $x = \frac{a}{b}, y = \frac{c}{d}$, where $a, b, c, d$ are all integers.

$$
x + y = \frac{ad + bc}{bd} 
$$

Since we know that the sum and products of integers are also integers, we get that $\frac{ad + bc}{bd}$ must be rational as well since it has an integer numerator and denominator.

16.  Claim: The product of two integers, one of the form $3k_{1} + 1$ and the other of the form $3k_{2} + 2$, where $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are integers, is of the form $3k_{3} + 2$ for some integer $k_{3}$ .

$$
\begin{align}
(3k_{1} + 1)(3k_{2} + 2) &= 9k_{1}k_{2} + 3k_{1} + 3k_{2} + 2 \\
&= 3(3k_{1}k_{2} + k_{1} + k_{2}) + 2
\end{align}
$$

Letting $k_{3} = 3k_{1}k_{2} + k_{1} + k_{2}$, we prove the claim to be true.

19. Setting the 3 theorems to T1, T2, and T3, respectively, we get that they are used in the proof in the order T1, T2, T3.
