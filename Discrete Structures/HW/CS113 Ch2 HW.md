7. **Claim**: If $m$ and $n$ are even, $m + n$ is even
**Proof**:
Let $m = 2a$ and $n = 2b$ by the definition of an even number.
Then
$$
\begin{align}
m + n &= 2a + 2b \\
&= 2(a + b)
\end{align}
$$
The above shows that $m + n$ must be even since $2(a + b)$ is an even number by definition.

13. For all rational number $x$ and $y$, $x + y$ is rational.
