# Modern State Idea

Territoriality was different 400-500 years ago

## Pre-1600s

Tribes behaved territorially but not exclusively. Plains tribe shared hunting grounds if friendly, fought if not friendly. Own territory communally. Similar in Southeast Asia and Africa, Europe. Pre-1600's, rulers had control but no specific rules.

## European State Idea

1600s. Influenced modern state system. Southeastern shore of Medjiterranean Sea had distinct kingdoms and territories. 

Greek philosophy and governance -> Rome -> modern state idea.

Rhys Jones: first states in Wales were small but modern. Late Middle Ages, larger states in UK, France, Spain. No clear evolution, but in Europe fs.

Early 17th century: Republic of Venice, Brandenburg, Papal states, Hungary, minor German states -> political entities and mercantilism -> colonization + plunder -> wealth -> protection of home industries and foreign markets -> competitive politics in Europe

**Peace of Westphalia**: peace negotiated in 1648 by Holy Roman Empire and neighbors. Conclude 30 years war over religion, created modern state by defining rights of rulers and territories, set standard within western and central Europe

Creation of wealthy middle class -> decline of nobility -> urban power > land -> 1780's upheaval, including French revolution.

# Nations

**Nations**
- are defined variously based on culture
- share culture, history, religion, language, ethnicity
- seek autonomy
- are mixtures of different people
- Example: French are mixture of Celts, Ancient Romans, Franks, Goths, and more
- often have different borders than state
- can be constructed identity
- "imagined community" - Benedict Anderson

# Nation-State

**Nation-state**: overlap between nation and state
Creation idea started during French Revolution. Nation w/ sovereign territory -> true democracy, ultimate political-territorial organization. However, nation-state overlap doesn't really exist.
Quest to create -> nationalism. State cannot have nationalism, government can. Nationalism -> integration into nation (France and Spain), culture into state (Germany, Italy), and separation (Iceland, Norway, Poland)
State provides security, goods, services -> nationalism -> nation-state:
- colonization of Africa and Asian in 1800-1900 -> nationalism in colonial empire by contrast with "savage" colonies

# Multistate Nation, Multinational States, Stateless Nations

**Multinational state**
- state with >1 nations
- Includes almost every state.
- Yugoslavia had too many nations != state
- Iraq: Iraqi and Kurds

**Multistate nation**
- nation = many states
- Transylvania connected to both Hungary and Romania
- Kurdistan?
- "Nations will defend their territory like language, religion, or way of life" - White

**Stateless nations**
- nation with no state
- Palestine Arabs have control over Gaza + occupied territories but not state yet.
- Kurds in Kurdistan w/ Diyarbakir but no state, need consent of Turkey

Stateless can be multistate.
