> [!definition] Function
> %% label: function %%
> A function $f$ is a [[Sets|set]] of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that no two ordered pairs have the same first number.

- $y$ determined by $x$ $\implies$ $y=f(x)$
- $f:X \to Y$, $X$ is domain, $Y$ is range or superset of range

# Injection

> [!definition] Injective
> %% label: injective %%
> $f$ is injective if $\forall y \in Y, \, \exists! x \mid f(x) = y$.

- notice we can also think of this as one to one from y to x
	- one y has one x

# Surjection

> [!definition] Surjection
> %% label: surjection %%
> $f: X \to Y$ is surjective if $Y$ is the image of $f$, i.e. for every $y \in Y$, there is $x \in X \mid f(x) = y$.

- notice that this is "onto" from y to x
	- every $y$ has at least one $x$.

# Bijection

> [!definition] Bijection
> %% label: bijection %%
> $f$ is bijective if it is injective and surjective.

- intuitively, this is "one-to-one" both ways

# Intervals

> [!definition] Neighborhod
> %% label: neighborhod %%
> Any open interval with $a$ as its midpoint is a neighborhood of $a$.

# Extremum

> [!definition] Extremum
> %% label: extremum %%
> $f$ has an absolute maximum on a set $S$ if there is at least one $c \in S\mid f(x)\leq f(c)$ for all $x \in S$. Absolute minimum is defined similarly. An extremum is an absolute max or min.
