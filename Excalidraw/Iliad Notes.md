# Sending Patroklos into battle

Achilleus breaks the Greek warrior system by sending Patroklos in instead of him. Also breaks pact with Zeus because Trojans set fire to ships but he still doesn't attack.

# Armor gets stolen

Armor represents Achilleus' honor, but in Hektor's hands. Big disgrace in Greek culture. Represents how Achilleus' menis results in his friend dying as well as honor being lost. Armor was also gift from gods -> even larger role in honor and identity. New armor represents help from gods, more in touch than ever with immmortal side, like a divine rebirth on the battlefield.

# Funeral Games

Achilleus gives out gifts based on performance in games, just like Greek warrior system. At the same time, his generosity => he no longer cares about material wealth. End of funeral game formally makes up with Agamemnon.

# Chapter 24 

Apollo's view on helping Hektor -> Greek warrior system but with gods? 

Achilleus starts to get over menis, returns to mortal when Priam brings up father-son bond . He only wants the best for Patroklos -> back to beginning when he cares about people.
