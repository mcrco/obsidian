# Uday

## Design

- emergency cart (again)
- used pendulum to oscillate cuz spring sucks
- meh materials

## Coefficient of Restitution

- cart collide with baseball -> elasticity
- 0.1537
- **didn't take rotation into account??**

## MoI

- experimental just like us

## Harmonic Motion

- decent data
- good computational

## COM

- very clever approach

## Rotational

- wrapped ball around wheele and dropped
- good approach
- used conservation of energy with wheel velocity
