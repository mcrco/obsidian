# Uday

## Design

- emergency cart (again)
- used pendulum to oscillate cuz spring sucks
- meh materials

## Coefficient of Restitution

- cart collide with baseball -> elasticity
- 0.1537
- **didn't take rotation into account??**

## MoI

- experimental just like us

## Harmonic Motion

- decent data
- good computational

## COM

- very clever approach

## Rotational

- wrapped ball around wheele and dropped
- good approach
- used conservation of energy with wheel velocity

# Pratham

## Design

- cool oscillating wings (ornithopter)
	- crank with rubber band
- bird that represents conservation of nature 
- beautiful preesentation

## COM

- balanced on fulcrum

## CoR

- pretty carppy collision with hot wheels cart

## DHM

- wing oscilllation periods vs amplitude
	- linear
- tracked y coord of center of wings

## Rotational Dynamics

- probably works, sounds very conceptual tho no computation

## MOI

- crank

## Rotational Kinematics and Energy

- cranked rubber band
- found k constant by equating $\frac{1}{2}kx^{2} = \frac{1}{I\omega^{2}}$
- huge percent error
	- friction and stuff

# Amy Kaitlyn Jerry

## Design

- repurposed frog
- even coolre
- LILYPAD
	- microwave plate
- loosened hex screws on tongue for friction less

## COM

- manually by breaking down into components

## CoR

- collision between frog and cart
- collision dampener
- lot of friction
- didn't demonstrate understanding
	- averaged 5 values?
	- different for diff velos

## MOI

- also theoretical
- pretty clever breakdown of hexagon lilypad into small equilateral -> centroids -> parallel axis

## Rot Kin/Dyn

- applied torque
- compared theoretical and experimental value with final angular velo
- calculated torque again and friction coefficient with angular momentum

## DHM

- used the dampener tongue
- very cool
- friction between screws
- also used pendulum
- 

# Eco Clean (Nathan)

## Design

- recycled cardboard lmao
- wooden chassis
- pvc
- cleans up environment even though im pretty sure those cardboard pieces are biodegradable

## COM

- prove by torque (force through com = no torque)
- found by cog with dangling string

## COR

- collision with wall
- measured velocity before and after

## MoI

- proof with pendulum
- rly good percent error

## Rot Kin

- roll down ramp
- used experimental values with kinematics equations

## DHM

- same as us with up down motion
- very good R^2 fit with underdamped
- drag coefficient calculation
- nathan has a thing for graphs

# Portable Christmas Tree (Chris Michael Nathan Josh)

## Design

- tree

## CoR

- spring hit wall
- vertical camera work

## CoM

- very hard to calculate
- used pendulum
- graphed velocity of cart and used coefficient?

## MoI

- wheels
- same breakdown as us

## Rot Kin

- acceleration isn't constant
- use integral derirvation for their own case
- angular velocity vs time -> angular displacement

## Rot Dyn

- mousetrap torque to find force by graphing velocity with respect to time -> angular accleeration -> torque -> force

## Energy

- used translational KE and rotational KE 
- rot KE small -> efficient

## SHM

- 13% error
- some shit i don't understand

### Lagrange

- used lagrangian because unknown force/acceleration
- friction and frictionless
- what the hell
- worse than shm

## DHM

- ok it works and they found b or smth my brain got friend during the previous concept
