$\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}, \dots \vec{v}_{p}$ are linearly independent iff 

$$
c_{1}\vec{v}_{1} + c_{2} \vec{v}_{2} \dots = 0
$$

has only trivial solution $\vec{c} = \vec{0}$

A set of vectors is linearly dependent if one of the following happen:

1. $v_{i} = \vec{0}$
2. $\vec{v}_{i} = k\vec{v}_{m}$
3. A vector is a linear combination of the rest
4. The number of vectors is greater than the number of components of each vector.
