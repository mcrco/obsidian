Consider the homegenous second-order differential equation

$$
y''(x) + a(x)y'(x) + b(x)y(x) = 0
$$

where $a(x), b(x)$ are continuous functions.

## Solution

1. Closure under vector addition

$$
\begin{align}
y_{1}^{\prime \prime} + a(x)y_{1}^\prime + b(x)y_{1} &= 0 \\
y_{2}^{\prime \prime} + a(x)y_{2}^\prime + b(x)y_{2} &= 0 \\
\end{align}
$$

Let $y = y_{1} + y_{2}$.

$$
\begin{align}
y^{\prime \prime} &= y_{1}^{\prime \prime} + y_{2}^{\prime \prime} \\
y^\prime &= y_{1}^\prime + y_{2}^\prime \\
y^{\prime \prime} + a(x) y^\prime + b(x)y &= 0
\end{align}
$$

2. Commutative

Trivial

3. Association

Trivial

4. Additive identity

Let $y(x)$ = 0


5. Closure under scalar multiplicaiton

Trivial

6. 1st distribution

Trivial if 5 works

7. 2nd distribution

Yardy know

8. Additive inverse

Just make it negative???

9. Multiplicative inverse

1 works lol

10. Association for scalar multiplication

Trivial once again
