# Why Chemistry

- chemistry is interesting (what is blud yapping about)
	- when ammonia molecular structure inverts, electrons pass through 0 probability region (wtf?? actually kinda cool)
	- rate of reaction $\implies$ chemical fatalism?? (what is blud yapping about x2)
- potential to impact humanity
	- $CH_{4}+O_{2}\to CO_{2}+2H_{2}O$
		- capture environmental methane, power UK for a year
	- $N_{2}+3H_{2}\to NH_{3}$
		- 2% of global energy consumption comes from making fertilizer (bruh)
