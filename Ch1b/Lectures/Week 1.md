# Why Chemistry

- chemistry is interesting (what is blud yapping about)
	- when ammonia molecular structure inverts, electrons pass through 0 probability region (wtf?? actually kinda cool)
	- rate of reaction $\implies$ chemical fatalism?? (what is blud yapping about x2)
- potential to impact humanity
	- $CH_{4}+O_{2}\to CO_{2}+2H_{2}O$
		- capture environmental methane, power UK for a year
	- $N_{2}+3H_{2}\to NH_{3}$
		- 2% of global energy consumption comes from making fertilizer (bruh)
# Organic Chemistry

- study of carbon containing compound
- carbon has great properties for being building block framework
	- can accumulate charge
	- [[Electrons in Atoms#Electronegativity|Pauline Electronegativity]] is intermediate

## Alkanes

- all C-H or C-C bonds, fully saturated
- n-alkanes: all C are bonded to <2C
	- $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$
- all $C$ are tetrahedral + $sp^{3}$

### Rules for Shorthand

1. all carbons are vertices or points
2. each line is bond
3. assume all $C$ are at octet

### Types

- n-alkanes
- cyclic alkanes
