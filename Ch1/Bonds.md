- holds atoms together
- change the properties
- care about nature of bond and resulting shapes
	- example: graphene vs polyethylene
	- insert hexagon vs chain

Let's consider the simple molecule H2

- forms of energy
	- potential: energy due to position or composition
	- kinetic: motion
 
## Ionic Bond

- complete transfer of one or more electrons from one atom to another
- has dipoles

## Covalent Bonds

- electrons are shared evenly

## Polar-Covalent Bonds

- gray area between ionic and covalent
- somewhat closer to one atom than another

# Energy

Let's consider the simple molecule $H_{2}$.

## Potential Energy

- energy due to composition or position

$$
V = V_{en}+V_{e e } + V_{nn}
$$

- $V_{en}$ is attractive
- $V_{e e} + V_{nn}$ are repulsive

$$
V = \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{r_{1a}} + \frac{1}{r_{2a}} + \frac{1}{r_{1B}} + \frac{1}{r_{2B}} \right) + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{r_{12}} \right) + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{R_{AB}} \right)
$$

## Total Energy

$$
E = \sum \text{KE}_{e} + \sum \text{KE}_{n} + V
$$
