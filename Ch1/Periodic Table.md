# Period Table

- combines like elements together
	- like = similar electron configurations in [[Atoms]]
- columns are groups
- rows are periods
- organizes elements into families
	- similar chemical properties
	- arranged with increasing [[Atoms#Nucleus|atomic number (z)]]
	- different ways to categorize
		- metals, nonmentals, metalloids
		- transition metals, main group, noble gases
		- alkali, alkaline-earth, chalcogens, halogens, lanthanides, actinides
- tells us how electrons are arranged for each element
	- as atomic number goes up, so does number of electrons
- trends are based on [[Electrons#Quantum Numbers#Electron Configurations|similar electron configurations]]

# Periodic Trends

## Size (Radial)

- impacts reactivity, physical properties
- $\propto$ electron energy
- includes electrons
	- electron cloud is $10^5$ times larger than nucleus
 
- **INCREASES WHEN**
	- GOING DOWN
		- increases in principle quantum number
	- GOING LEFT
		- going right adds electrons to same valence
		- effective nuclear charge remains same going to the right
			- $Z_{\text{eff}}=Z-S$
				- $Z$ increases because increase in protons
				- $S$ (screening constant) because only adding core electrons increases screening

## [[Electrons#Ionization Energy|Ionization Energy]]

- **INCREASES WHEN**
	- going UP
	- going RIGHT

## Electron Affinity

- energy required to detach electron from anion to yield neutral atom
	- energy released when atom gains an electron

- **INCREASES WHEN**
	- going UP
	- going RIGHT
