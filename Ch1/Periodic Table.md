# Period Table

- combines like elements together
	- like = similar electron configurations in [[Atoms]]
- columns are groups
- rows are periods
- organizes elements into families
	- similar chemical properties
	- arranged with increasing [[Atoms#Nucleus|atomic number (z)]]
	- different ways to categorize
		- metals, nonmentals, metalloids
		- transition metals, main group, noble gases
		- alkali, alkaline-earth, chalcogens, halogens, lanthanides, actinides
- tells us how electrons are arranged for each element
	- as atomic number goes up, so does number of electrons
- trends are based on [[Electrons#Quantum Numbers#Electron Configurations|similar electron configurations]]

# Periodic Trends

## Size (Radial)

- impacts reactivity, physical properties
- $\propto$ electron energy
- includes electrons
	- electron cloud is $10^5$ times larger than nucleus
 
- **INCREASES WHEN**
	- GOING DOWN
		- increases in principle quantum number
	- GOING LEFT
		- going right adds electrons to same valence
		- effective nuclear charge remains same going to the right
			- $Z_{\text{eff}}=Z-S$
				- $Z$ increases because increase in protons
				- $S$ (screening constant) because only adding core electrons increases screening

## [[Electrons#Ionization Energy|Ionization Energy]]

- **INCREASES WHEN**
	- going UP
	- going RIGHT

## Electron Affinity

- energy required to detach electron from anion to yield neutral atom
	- energy released when atom gains an electron

- **INCREASES WHEN**
	- going UP 
		- less 
	- going RIGHT
		- elements like Li and K can become noble gas if giving away electron

  
# Electronegativity

- **INCREASES WHEN** 
	- going UP
	- going RIGHT
 
- tendency of an atom to attract share $e^{-}$
	- bonds
	- relative
- example: Cl and Na
	- electron from Na will go to Cl because Cl more stable
	- $Na^{+}Cl^{-}$
- causes dipoles in [[Bonds#Ionic Bond|ionic bonds]]

## Scales

### Mulliken

$$
EN=\frac{1}{2}C(1E_{1}+EA),
$$

$C$ is a proportionality constant.

### Pauling

$$
EN=\pi
$$

- $\pi$ related to bond dissocation
- A-A
	- perfectly covalent
	- $\Delta E_{AA}$ = bond dissociation E
- B-B
	- $\Delta E_{BB}$ = bond dissociation E
- consider A-B
	- covalent character of A-B = $\sqrt{ \Delta E_{A A} \Delta E_{B B} }$
	- ionic character = $\Delta$ (excess bond energy)
		- $\Delta=\Delta E_{AB}-\sqrt{ \Delta E_{A A} \Delta E_{B B} }$
	- define $\pi$ in terms of $\Delta$
		- $\pi_{A}-\pi_{B}=0.102\Delta^{1/2}$
	- EN diff > 2 = ionic bond
	- EN diff = 0 = covalent bond
