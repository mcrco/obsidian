# Period Table/Periodic Trends

- combines like elements together
	- like = similar electron configurations in [[Atoms]]
- columns are groups
- rows are periods
- organizes elements into families
	- similar chemical properties
	- arranged with increasing [[Atoms#Nucleus|atomic number (z)]]
	- different ways to categorize
		- metals, nonmentals, metalloids
		- transition metals, main group, noble gases
		- alkali, alkaline-earth, chalcogens, halogens, lanthanides, actinides
- tells us how electrons are arranged for each element
	- as atomic number goes up, so does number of electrons
- trends are based on [[Electrons#Quantum Numbers|similar electron configurations]]
