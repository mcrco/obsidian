- $e^{-}$
- $9.11\cdot 10^{-31}\text{ kg}$
- forms cloud around nucleus

# Quantum Numbers

- electrons live in orbitals around nucleus
	- orbitals have size, shape, energy
 
## 4 Quantum Numbers

- principal quantum number (N)
	- indexes energy level
- angular momentum quantum number $l$
	- related to shape
	- $l=0 \to s$, $l=1 \to p, l=2\to d, l=3\to f, l=4 \to g$
- magnetic qn, $m_{l}$
	- integrals values $l \to -l$
- electron spin qn, $m_{s}$
	- $+\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}$
	- 2 electrons live in orbital described by first 3 quantum numbers
		- Hartree atomic orbital is first 3 quantum numbers
  
## Rules 

Basically, electrons ALWAYS go for LOWER ENERGY. This summarizes all of chemistry.

### Aufbau Principle

- describes ground state electron configuration of atom
	- ground state: lowest energy state of atom
- built up by arranging the Hartree atomic orbitals in order of increasing energy
- electrons always fill lower energy orbitals before higher energy orbitals**
- **exceptions** starting in period 4
	- energy of $4s$ and $3d$ subshells are very similar
	- $\epsilon_{4s} < \epsilon_{3d}$
		- $K:[Ar]3d^{0}4s_{1}$
		- $Ca:[Ar]3d^{0}4s^{2}$
	- $\epsilon_{3d}< \epsilon_{4s}$
		- when putting >3 electrons into 3d orbitals, there is electrostatic repulsion energy ($\epsilon_{\text{er}}$)
		- $\epsilon_{\text{er d-orbital}} \gg \epsilon_{\text{er s-orbital}}$ because localized vs diffused
		- $\epsilon_{\text{er d}} > |\epsilon_{3d} - \epsilon_{4s}|$
	- half filled + fully filled shells -> lower energy -> $4s$ electrons sometimes go to $3d$ to fill last spot for fully filled/half filled subshell
		- $Cu: [Ar]3d^{10}4s ^{1}$
		- $Cr: [Ar]3d^{5}4s ^{1}$
  
- Pauli Exclusion Principle: no 2 atoms can have same 4 qn
- Hund's Rules
	- when electrons are added to Hartree orbitals of equal energy, all orbitals will be singly occupied before any is doubly occupied
		- lowest electron config has parallel spins

## Electron Configurations

- Example configurations:
	- H: $1s ^{1}$
	- He: $1s^{2}$
	- Li: $1s^{2}, 2s ^{1}$
	- B: $1s^{2}, 2s^{2}, 2p^{1}$
	- C: $1s^{2}, 2s^{2}, 2p^{2}$

## Ionization Energy

- energy required to remove electron from orbitals to vacuum (0 energy)
- measured by **photoelectron spectroscopy**
	- shots photon at electron with certain energy
	- produces graph with peaks in energy that represents atomic subshells
- energy level differences $\to$ **valence** vs **core** electrons
- **valence electrons**
	- outermost shells
	- participate in bonding
- **core electrons**
	- all the others
	- (Ry) rydberg energy: $2.18\cdot {10}^{-18}$ J
		- boundary between valence and core electrons
		- $|e_{a}-e_{b}| < \text{Ry} \implies$ $e_{a}$ is valence electron if $e_{b}$ is valence electorn and vice versa
