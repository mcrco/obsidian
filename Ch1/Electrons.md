# Quantum Numbers

- electrons live in orbitals around nucleus
	- orbitals have size, shape, energy
- 4 quantum numbers describe nucleus
	- principal quantum number (N)
		- indexes energy level
	- angular momentum quantum number $l$
		- related to shape
		- $l=0 \to s$, $l=1 \to p, l=2\to d, l=3\to f, l=4 \to g$
	- magnetic qn, $M$
		- integrals values $l \to -l$
	- electron spin qn, $M_{s}$
		- $+\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}$
		- 2 electrons live in orbital described by first 3 quantum numbers
			- Hartree atomic orbital is first 3 quantum numbers
- Aufhau principle
	- describes ground state electron configuration of atom
		- ground state: lowest energy state of atom
	- built up by arranging the Hartree atomic orbitals in order of increasing energy
	- electrons always fill lower energy orbitals before higher energy orbitals
- Pauli Exclusion Principle: no 2 atoms can have same 4 qn
- Hund's Rules
	- when electrons are added to Hartree orbitals of equal energy, all orbitals will be singly occupied before any is doubly occupied
		- lowest electron config has parallel spins
- Example configurations:
	- H: $1s ^{1}$
	- He: $1s^{2}$
	- Li: $1s^{2}, 2s ^{1}$
	- B: $1s^{2}, 2s^{2}, 2p^{1}$
	- C: $1s^{2}, 2s^{2}, 2p^{2}$
- ionization energy: energy required to remove electron from orbitals to vacuum (0 energy)
