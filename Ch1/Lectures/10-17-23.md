# Bonds

## Polarity

- absolute value of the difference in electronegativity between 2 bonded atoms
	- large difference > 2 => ionic
	- small < 0.4 => covalent
	- in between 0.4 -> 2 => polar covalent
- $H^{\delta+}-F^{\delta-}$: $\Delta = |2.2-3.98| = 1.78$
- $\delta$
	- fraction of charge on each atom
	- $q=\delta e$ is total charge
	- $\delta$ is 1 and 0 for ionic bond
	- measurable
		- $\mu = (\frac{R}{0.2082 \mathcal{A}})\delta$ is dipole moment in debye
		- $R$ is bond length in $\mathcal{A}$
		- for HF, $\mu=1.82\text{D}, R=0.917\mathcal{A} \implies \delta = 1.82\text{D}(\frac{0.2082\mathcal{A}}{0.917\mathcal{A}}=0.41$ ionic
  
## Polar Covalent

- mixture of ionic and covalent

# Lewis Dot/VSEPR

- predicts structural formula -> sequence of atoms bonded

1. draw atom with valence $e^{-}$
2. octet rule: main group surrounded by $8e^{-}$
	- 2 in s orbital, 6 in p orbital
	- exception is $H$, $He$ (surrounded by 2)
