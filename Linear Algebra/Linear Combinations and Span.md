In xy plane, $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ are called **basis vectors**. 

Using a linear combination (scaled sum) of $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$, we can reach any vector in 2D space. In this case, the 2D space is the **span** (set of all possible linear combinations) of $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$. 

Notice that the span is not the same for basis vectors that line up or are 0.

The property that describes a basis vector that adds another dimension to span is **linear independence**. 

**Technical definition of basis**: The basis of a vector sdpace is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.
