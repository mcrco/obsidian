> [!math|{"type":"definition","number":"auto","setAsNoteMathLink":false,"title":"Function","label":"function","_index":0}] Definition 1 (Function).
> A function $f$ is a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that no two ordered pairs have the same first number.

- $y$ determined by $x$ $\implies$ $y=f(x)$
- $f:X \to Y$, $X$ is domain, $Y$ is range or superset of range

# Injection

> [!math|{"type":"definition","number":"auto","setAsNoteMathLink":false,"title":"Injective","label":"injective","_index":1}] Definition 2 (Injective).
> $f$ is injective if $\forall y \in Y, \, \exists! x \mid f(x) = y$.

- notice we can also think of this as one to one from y to x
	- one y has one x

# Surjection

> [!math|{"type":"definition","number":"auto","setAsNoteMathLink":false,"title":"Surjection","label":"surjection","_index":2}] Definition 3 (Surjection).
> $f: X \to Y$ is surjective if $Y$ is the image of $f$, i.e. for every $y \in Y$, there is $x \in X \mid f(x) = y$.

- notice that this is "onto" from y to x
	- every $y$ has at least one $x$.

# Bijection

> [!math|{"type":"definition","number":"auto","setAsNoteMathLink":false,"title":"Bijection","label":"bijection","_index":3}] Definition 4 (Bijection).
> $f$ is bijective if it is injective and surjective.

- intuitively, this is "one-to-one" both ways

# Intervals

> [!math|{"type":"definition","number":"auto","setAsNoteMathLink":false,"title":"Neighborhod","label":"neighborhod","_index":4}] Definition 5 (Neighborhod).
> Any open interval with $a$ as its midpoint is a neighborhood of $a$.
