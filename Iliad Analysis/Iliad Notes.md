# Gifts in Abundance

Agamemnon says he will give Achilleus gifts in abundance if he returns.

Gifts in abundance = ransom
- looks like Aga is apologizing but is really using the opportunity to blame the losing situation on Achilleus ransoming his own warfare
- clearly his fault for pissing off achilleus in the first place
- on the topic of pissing off achilleus:
	- Aga broke Greek warrior system
	- Using gifts in abundance != fixing the Greek warrior system because the gifts should have been given as reward for prowess, not payment in advance
- reveals Agamemnons incompetency as a leader, still doesn't admit to his wrongdoing + doesn't realize he has fundamentally broken the Greek warrior system

# Trojans Set Fire to Ships

Ships are crazy symbolic. 
- ships = last line of defense, only retreat. Ship destoryed = hopes destroyed
- Setting fire = Achilleus sign to go into battle as part of his pact with Zeus and the other Achaians. Not doing so -> Zeus mad cuz hubris. Once again, menis + immortal side is showing.

# Sending Patroklos into battle

Achilleus breaks the Greek warrior system by sending Patroklos in instead of him. Also breaks pact with Zeus because Trojans set fire to ships but he still doesn't attack. Shows immortal godly wannabe side because he watches from the back of the ships, just like the gods watch the mortals fight. This is hubris, and he gets punished for it.

# Armor gets stolen

Armor represents Achilleus' honor, but in Hektor's hands. Big disgrace in Greek culture. Represents how Achilleus' menis results in his friend dying as well as honor being lost. Armor was also gift from gods -> even larger role in honor and identity. New armor represents help from gods, more in touch than ever with immmortal side, like a divine rebirth on the battlefield.

# Funeral Games

Achilleus gives out gifts based on performance in games, just like Greek warrior system. At the same time, his generosity => he no longer cares about material wealth. End of funeral game formally makes up with Agamemnon.

# Chapter 24 

Apollo's view on helping Hektor -> Greek warrior system but with gods? 

Achilleus starts to get over menis, returns to mortal when Priam brings up father-son bond . He only wants the best for Patroklos and allows ceasefire -> back to beginning when he cares about people.
